This is a community-enhanced, "jumbo" version of John the Ripper.
It has a lot of code, documentation, and data contributed by the
user community.  This is not "official" John the Ripper code.  It is
very easy for new code to be added to jumbo: the quality requirements
are low.  This means that you get a lot of functionality that is not
"mature" enough or is otherwise inappropriate for the official JtR,
which in turn also means that bugs in this code are to be expected.

If you have any comments on this release or on JtR in general, please
join the john-users mailing list and post in there.
